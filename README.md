# ARCSAT_Light_Curve  

This repository contains the code to analyze a series of science images of an eclipsing binary star system and produce a light curve.  

Example usage can be found in the jupyter notebooks (in the order reduction_2 then photometry_2).  

To use the functions yourself, you can pass the inputs to Bias.py, then Dark.py, then Flat.py followed by the Reduction.py and Photometry.py.  

Optionally, filing contains useful code to determine Readout Noise and Gain as well as some code that can be used to sort a directory of files.
